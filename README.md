#### Log

To improve knowledge sharing and experimentation, please document how to build and run your code. It can also be nice to keep a log here:

##### _28/11_

_Today I forked this repository in preparation of the start._

##### _01/12 (~1h)_ 

_Started working on the problem quite late after it was made available._  
_The first execise proved to be pretty simple (just a summation of numbers)._  
_The second exercise was a bit harder. I started out wanting to use Java 8's streams to solve it, but was unable to find a readable solution. Eventually I reverted to a good old for loop_  
_Quite a bit of time was also wasted on getting IntelliJ to pick up the file with the input data -\_-_

##### _02/12 (~1h 15m)_

_The problem wasn't as easy as on the first day, but it was easy to break down into sub-problems._  
_I started of writing some tests for these sub-problems before beginning to write the actual implementation_  
_Finding the correct solution proved to be quite painless because of this_  

_I also worked on a different machine which made me have to do the project setup again. Took me quite a while to get IntelliJ to execute my code again today -\_-_
